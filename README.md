# Graduate Research Fellowship Application Execution Plan

This repository provides a simple execution plan for the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) based on 2021 latest solicitations. Moreover, this effort is in part inspired by an email from [Joe Cloud](https://github.com/cloudy) (2020 NSF GRF recipient) where provides helpful resources in addition to what's provided by the program organizers. Also please check out his repo on [NSF GRFP Analysis](https://github.com/cloudy/nsf-grfp-analysis).

Great progress is often the result of a collective effort and success is not a zero game. Please feel free to make a pull request or fork it for your own use.

## NSF GRFP Execution Plan

- [ ] Read NSF Proposal Review Guide [nsf20001](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg20_1/nsf20_1.pdf)
- [ ] [Application Process Infographic](https://nsfgrfp.org/applicants/grfp-application-process-infographic/)
- [ ] [NSF GRFP Tips](https://nsfgrfp.org/applicants/tips/)
- [ ] Search for recent similar funded grants from [award-search](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/)
- [ ] If you're trying to figure out the focus, one thing to try is skim through
      recent (but well-received) survey papers. The future works/needs sections tend
      to highlight problems that can be helpful for identifying challenges for us
      grad students to focus on.

### Merit Review Criteria

- [source](https://nsfgrfp.org/applicants/)
- Two main documents
  - Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement
  - Graduate Research Statement
- Each must have "Intellectual Merit" and "Broader Impacts" sections or it needs to be addressed in text.
- <b>Intellectual Merit:</b> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge
- <b>Broader Impact:</b> The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
- <b>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</b>
  1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to:
     A. Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
     B. Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
  2. To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
  3. Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
  4. How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
  5. Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
